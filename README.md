# TensorStar
Flexible Tensor Runtime with Magic.  
See [Wiki](https://github.com/wenxcs/TensorStar/wiki) for latest information!

T* = TensorStar   
T* will explain TGraph using graph-runtime and execute each operator by op-runtime using kernel provided from workspace   
T* will generate native call of each operator thus improve efficiency
